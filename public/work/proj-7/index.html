<strong>Let Me Count The Ways (Portland, VIC)</strong> was a project done in 2014, as part of a larger project of the same name in which people from  regional and rural Victoria document and share what they love about where they live and what they do. I contributed a <a href="https://rogeralsop.wixsite.com/counting-the-ways/about1">surface-exciting speaker installation (click for a shaky camera preview)</a> at the <a href="http://www.visitportland.com.au/listings/julia-street-creative-space-2/">Julia St Creative Space, Portland</a>, and the display of photographs and other beloved objects and stories from people throughout the town and region.

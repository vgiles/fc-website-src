**Blorbs JS Applet**: This little gizmo is an interactive sound work, where the user chases the blorbs around the screen, each one plays samples at different rates/spatial positions depending where they are when touched. You can in principle "finish" the experience by chasing all the circles out of the screen. It is an example of a musical experience being both score and instrument. [Experience it here (use Google Chrome for best results)](https://www.vgiles.net/projects/blorbs/index.html)

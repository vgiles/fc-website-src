**Heard/Unheard:Flux**: The idea of the work was a response to the Bonney Upwelling – a natural marine process during which winds direct surface water away from the coast, causing arctic water from the bottom of the ocean to be brought to the surface, bringing with it vast quantities of microbial life that feed krill and other creatures, which in turn attract blue whales and other large marine animals for feeding and provide the perfect environment for large-scale breeding.
I was looking for a way to represent this event sonically, to juxtapose the sound of the Upwelling against the sound of natural and urban land-based environments and the sound of the festival itself.  In effect creating three “layers” of sound, indicating that the heard and the unheard are always in flux.

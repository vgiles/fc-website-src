## Intro
I'm Vincent Giles, an Australian composer born in 1985 and based in Naarm (Melbourne). My work explores the fragile boundaries of perception, the beauty in instability, and those fascinating glitches that emerge from both human and machine creativity.
My music has traveled across North America, Europe, South-East Asia, and throughout Australia, brought to life by incredible performers like Peter Sheridan, Lizzy Welsh, Alice Bennett, Halfsound, Arcko Symphonic Ensemble, and Fragments Ensemble. You might have heard my work at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse, Tura Totally Huge New Music Festival, various Fringe Festivals in Melbourne, Sydney and Newcastle, or during the Impulse Festival and Academy for New Music.


## My work and ethos
I partner with artists, councils, and galleries to create sound that reveals new layers in its medium—whether for concert halls, games, installations, or public spaces. Sometimes, projects can falter or lack clarity from technical hurdles or mismatched visions, wasting chances to connect deeply with new and existing audiences.
With 20 years of experience in exploratory sound practice—from composing concert works (published by Wirripang, Edition Resonance, and Move Records) to producing ambisonic public art and directing Tilde New Music & Sound Art — I ensure your project thrives through:
  - End-to-end vision: Guiding from concept to post-production, with technical rigour meeting creative ambition.
  - Site-specific innovation: Transforming spaces (physical/virtual) through acoustic intelligence and conceptual rigour.
  - Permaculture-driven process: Systems-first design, iterative feedback, resilience over waste.

I can help you with any audio editing task, including podcasts, syncing to video footage, or overdubbing. I have done work editing podcasts, recording voice-overs (and editing to footage), and more.

If you are looking for a post-production engineer, I can help you work on your final mixdown, mastering for digital or traditional distribution, including experimental strategies such as binaural encoding.

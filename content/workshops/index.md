<!-- With nearly two decades of music education experience—including ten years in tertiary institutions like the Australian Institute of Music, Monash University, and Collarts—I've had the privilege of mentoring emerging artists who now thrive in their own creative careers. My approach blends rigorous training with the kind of real-world insights that only come from active artistic practice. I regularly share my perspective on creative practice through invited talks at:
- Community arts groups, like MediaLab Melbourne and Banyule City Council's Arts and Culture programme
- Academic spaces, such as the University of Melbourne and Bio 21 Laboratory
- Regional community arts spaces, like Julia St Creative Space on the South-West coast of Victoria.

In 2013 I co-founded *Tilde New Music and Sound Art Inc.* with [Alice Bennett](https://www.alicebennett.net), serving as co-director until 2020. Tilde was dedicated to public presentation and education of avant-garde music in the Oceanic region. This work culminated in a major eight-day festival, backed by over $100,000 in funding, which brought together panel discussions on equity in new music, cross-disciplinary performances across multiple venues, and our signature artist development academy. What began as a passion project grew into an organization that shaped conversations about music's evolving role in our culture—while giving me the chance to both teach in our academies and present my own creative work, and addressing a significant gap in the region. -->

    I can run workshops, deliver professional development, run a masterclass, and even offer some bespoke one-on-one coaching. As one mentee stated "you're doing the intricate groundwork that I can then actualise with clarity and confidence", and as a higher ed student commented "it's nice to be able to learn this stuff from somebody who has actually done it."

    Got a workshop idea in music but need a facilitator? Need somebody to talk on a panel? Or want to undertake some professional development for yourself? I got you. Draw on more than 20 years experience in the industry and higher education in leadership roles throughout.

    ️✔ You're after somebody with bonafide credentials (PhD, working with children check).

    ️✔ You need somebody who understands peoples' needs, both as a leader and from the ground up.

    ️✔ You want to rest easy in the knowledge that your facilitator has the utmost technical know-how.

    ️✔ You're unsure how to take the next steps in your career or even what those steps might be.

    ️✔ You need to upskill, either yourself, or a group of people you work with.

    ️✔ You want somebody who has (probably) been there and can talk from experience, at all levels.

    ✔ You are after a flexible and agile approach to your idea.

    **But might not be a great fit if...**

    ✖ You just want to tick some boxes.

    ✖ You want an easy fix (i.e. are unwilling to put in the work).

    ✖ You're not really interested in collaborating.

    I understand the changing demands of the arts sector, the requirements of leadership, and what it's like to be *in it* at a grassroots level.

    My career has taken me around the world as a composer and performer, and along the way I have been educating, facilitating, and helping other people achieve their goals in performance, research, composition, and production.
    I have been teaching at the tertiary level (right up to postgraduate) for over ten years, and have been in leadership positions throughout that time, managing people, curriculum, and governance responsibilities.
    I also co-founded an experimental music and sound art festival and academy, building it from a half-day event to an eight-day, international festival.

    Faulty Cat Productions is my way of acknowledging my quirks and access needs, whilst enveloping all of my special interests, including
    music composition.
    It has been a slow-burn build since 2022, with the focus on developing ethical and sustainable practices
    in an industry that very often lacks this. It draws on multiple episodes of both creative and general
    professional burnout across my life that were brought about by the constant push of the music industry and academia.

    Something needed to change, so I studied permaculture design in 2021 and it dramatically shifted my perspective on how to sustainably pursue my career in the arts.
    This has given me a unique perspective on a slow, observation-and-feedback driven approach to working to create work that focuses on diversity as a core tenant.
    Not only celebrating diversity of people in the world, but through my practices, that are not genre-based, or even technology based. 
    I believe in using the right tool for the job, and communicating clearly what I _can_ do and what I _can't_ do. 

    Ultimately, I want to build and model processes and business structures to inspire more people to create work in sustainable and meaningful ways.

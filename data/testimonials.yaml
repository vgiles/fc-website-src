  quote: "Vince has aided me in sound in two government-funded projects and was of tremendous support, technically and on a personal level. In the first project Vince assisted with voice recording, sound design and editing, and sound presentation in a public space. In the second project Vince supported three women to voice record us telling our stories of trauma which he then sound edited for a short film. Vince has the technical skills and personal warmth to collaborate with vulnerable people telling difficult stories, and that means the world to me. Thank you, Vince :)"

  role: "Arts and Cultural Development Office, Banyule City Council"
  quote: "As Arts and Cultural Development Officer for Banyule City Council I engaged Vincent to work on a number of different projects, including as a speaker and panelists in an online forum designed to support local artists to successfully respond to public art opportunities. As a highly skilled composer, producer and sound artist with experience installing work in the public realm, Vincent's contribution was invaluable. He provided insights and advice that were of clear benefit to emerging artists, and also informed my own processes and approach to designing arts projects. Vincent's extensive cross artform knowledge and responsive, contemporary practice provided a new and important perspective to the discussion about public art, and their engaging and inclusive presence was welcomed by other panelists and participants."

    If you've already read my story, then some of this will not be news to you. But if not, strap in.

    Sometimes we find that the arts is largely full of [insert link] people rich enough to be artists. And it is [insert link] increasingly well documented
    that the working class is being squeezed out of the arts, both through access to funding (I have had what I would 
    call more than my "fair" share of rejections!) and through the general cost of staying alive. 
    This doesn't only extend to the artists themselves, though, but to the broader arts sector. With increasing demands on time
    for bigger and bigger outcomes, things can get really intense for the people who work behind the scenes. 

    I started my professional music life as an electric bass player. I worked as a session musician, bass teacher,
    and general low-end-mischief-maker from around 2004 to 2013, when I gave it up in favour of composition and production.

    I come from a poor (low socio-economic status) background (fun fact: I sold my Nintendo 64 to buy my first bass around 1999, and I still have that bass), 
    moving _in_ to the working class. This has given me a strong sense of both justice, and also the struggle that a lot of people (other artists, arts workers, 
    your local Bunnings crew) experience. I understand fully how limited budgets can be, how hard it is to access funding, and the needs of making art in the current economic context. 

    I also understand that an intersection with SES is disability. I was diagnosed at age 39 as both autistic and ADHD, which was quite a shock. 
    But unpacking that and examining how it has influenced my life has been a real eye-opener, and I have pursued additional professional development in this area to
    help clients like you in a respectful, and agile way, to achieve your goals. I understand that every person is different, has different lived experience, 
    and that all of our working methods vary. No one approach works for everybody. I value open, honest communication, feedback and iteration, and agile responsiveness to 
    your personal and project needs.

    I bring decades of experience in the arts industry as a performer, composer, producer, recording engineer, educator (in and out of higher education). I have helped and taught
    people from all walks of life, and have experience in most aspects of the arts sector, including managing performances, festivals, funding, and people.

    * You want creative, high quality music that enhances whatever project you're working on. 
    * You want to work with somebody who _gets it_ from a grassroots perspective.
    * You're getting stuck understanding or implementing a technical or technological solution in your project.
    * You've dabbled in music production but are unsure where to go next.
    * You've got a great song or piece, but need to develop it further or add additional layers. 
    * You need somebody to bounce ideas off in a supportive (but constructively critical) way.

  content: >
    Faulty Cat Productions is my way of acknowledging my quirks and access needs, whilst enveloping all of my special interests, including
    music composition.
    It has been a slow-burn build since 2022, with the focus on developing ethical and sustainable practices
    in an industry that very often lacks this. It draws on multiple episodes of both creative and general
    professional burnout across my life that were brought about by the constant push of the music industry and academia.

    Something needed to change, so I studied permaculture design in 2021 and it dramatically shifted my perspective on how to sustainably pursue my career in the arts.
    This has given me a unique perspective on a slow, observation-and-feedback driven approach to working to create work that focuses on diversity as a core tenant.
    Not only celebrating diversity of people in the world, but through my practices, that are not genre-based, or even technology based. 
    I believe in using the right tool for the job, and communicating clearly what I _can_ do and what I _can't_ do. 

    Ultimately, I want to build and model processes and business structures to inspire more people to create work in sustainable and meaningful ways.

    The arts increasingly favor those with financial privilege, while working-class creators face mounting barriers such as funding access and time restraints. Having weathered my share of rejections, I know this struggle extends beyond artists to everyone in the cultural sector.

    My journey began as a bassist (I sold my Nintendo 64 for my first instrument in 1999 (and still have it today)). From session work (2004-2013) to composition, my working-class roots ground my understanding of creative constraints. I've lived the tension between artistic vision and economic reality that artists, arts workers, and everyday people face.

    My late neurodivergence diagnoses (autism/ADHD at 39) only served to re-emphasise how our systems are often not adequate for those who need them. My ongoing professional development and client approach is built on mutual respect, adaptability, and responsiveness. No two people are the same, and I know this. I value honest dialogue and iterative collaboration.

    Two decades across performing, composing, producing, and education have shown me the sector's full spectrum. Not just the people in it, but my own experiences from stage to studio and classroom. Whether you need technical solutions, creative development, or just a sounding board, I bring both grassroots perspective and professional rigor to our work.

    Faulty Cat Productions is my way of acknowledging my quirks and access needs, whilst enveloping all of my special interests, including
    music composition.
    It has been a slow-burn build since 2022, with the focus on developing ethical and sustainable practices
    in an industry that very often lacks this. It draws on multiple episodes of both creative and general
    professional burnout across my life that were brought about by the constant push of the music industry and academia.

    Something needed to change, so I studied permaculture design in 2021 and it dramatically shifted my perspective on how to sustainably pursue my career in the arts.
    This has given me a unique perspective on a slow, observation-and-feedback driven approach to working to create work that focuses on diversity as a core tenant.
    Not only celebrating diversity of people in the world, but through my practices, that are not genre-based, or even technology based. 
    I believe in using the right tool for the job, and communicating clearly what I _can_ do and what I _can't_ do. 

    Ultimately, I want to build and model processes and business structures to inspire more people to create work in sustainable and meaningful ways.

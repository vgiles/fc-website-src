    So you've finished your track, podcast, or voice-over recording but want to make it pop? I can help.

    I offer audio post-production including mixing, editing, and, if the circumstances call for it, certain audio mastering. I can synchronise your audio to video, and even do some video editing if the need arises. 
    Whatever the project, I'll sort out your post-production.

    ️✔ You want creative approaches to post-production that makes your assets stand out. 

    ️✔ You want to work with somebody who understands that many creative projects need treatment that are beyond the ordinary. 

    ️✔ You need a critical ear to determine the next steps.

    ️✔ You don't have the resources to do it yourself.

    ️✔ You need to demo a prototype to get a project off the ground and want it to be as good as possible.

    ️✔ You need somebody to bounce ideas off in a supportive (but constructively critical) way.

    ✔ You want to explore new realms of expression such as binaural encoding for immersion. 

    **But might not be a great fit if...**

    ✖ You just want everything to be loud (fun fact: volume tricks the brain into a false sense of "good").

    ✖ You don't want a creative approach, only a technical one. 

    ✖ You're not really interested in collaborating.

    Post-production is often seen as something that anybody can do. I've had so many conversations with people where they stick a preset on (or, these days, an AI plugin) a track and crank the volume up without understanding the process. 

    I began recording audio in the most lo-fi way possible – no audio interface, just a SoundBlaster soundcard in my PC – around 2002. 
    While those early attempts were nothing impressive, I went on to refine this process and record professional working bands that I was in, singer-songwriter friends, and my own experimental projects without access to even a basic recording interface (I couldn't afford one). 
    The results that are possible under such extreme limitations can be incredibly inspiring, and I bring this attitude of paring a process back to its absolute essentials to everything I do. To draw inspiration from restriction and use the tool that is right for the project.

    These days of course the equipment is much better, and computational power on even a mobile phone far exceeds what I was working with back then, but decades of experience in *making things work* has taught me to approach every project with curiosity and ask "what might be possible?"

    Faulty Cat Productions is my way of acknowledging my quirks and access needs, whilst enveloping all of my special interests, including
    music composition.
    It has been a slow-burn build since 2022, with the focus on developing ethical and sustainable practices
    in an industry that very often lacks this. It draws on multiple episodes of both creative and general
    professional burnout across my life that were brought about by the constant push of the music industry and academia.

    Something needed to change, so I studied permaculture design in 2021 and it dramatically shifted my perspective on how to sustainably pursue my career in the arts.
    This has given me a unique perspective on a slow, observation-and-feedback driven approach to working to create work that focuses on diversity as a core tenant.
    Not only celebrating diversity of people in the world, but through my practices, that are not genre-based, or even technology based. 
    I believe in using the right tool for the job, and communicating clearly what I _can_ do and what I _can't_ do. 

    Ultimately, I want to build and model processes and business structures to inspire more people to create work in sustainable and meaningful ways.

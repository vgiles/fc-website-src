I partner with artists, councils, and galleries to create sound that reveals new layers in its medium—whether for concert halls, games, installations, or public spaces. Sometimes, projects can falter or lack clarity from technical hurdles or mismatched visions, wasting chances to connect deeply with new and existing audiences.

With 20 years of experience in exploratory sound practice—from composing concert works (published by Wirripang, Edition Resonance, and Move Records) to producing ambisonic public art and directing Tilde New Music & Sound Art—I ensure your project thrives through:

- End-to-end vision: Guiding from concept to post-production, with technical rigour meeting creative ambition.
- Site-specific innovation: Transforming spaces (physical/virtual) through acoustic intelligence and conceptual rigour.
- Permaculture-driven process: Systems-first design, iterative feedback, resilience over waste.

Let’s turn your idea into a quietly transformative experience that is creatively uncompromising.

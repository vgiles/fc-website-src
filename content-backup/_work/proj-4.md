**Tilde New Music and Sound Art**: Festival of experimental music and art. 
From 2014 to 2020 I was the co-director, co-producer/manager, partner/vice-president, and treasure of Tilde New Music and Sound Art Inc., with [Alice Bennett](https://alicebennett.net). This saw five festivals, three academies, and in 2018, the incorporation and governance as a not-for-profit association in Victoria. This video shows some photos and video excerpts of parts of the festivals over the past five years.

**Stop, Listen**: 'the artist creates a structure ... that holds open contemplative space against the pressure of habit, familiarity, and distraction that constantly threaten to close it.Ê¼

-Jenny Odell (2019)

These structures provide a space for contemplation. They are placed so as to block out the sound behind them while subtly amplifying and transforming the sound in front. The structures also do interesting things to loud sounds projected at them from a distance, bouncing them around in interesting ways. To enjoy them the most, stand inside the structure and face out, close your eyes, and listen. As Jenny Odell says, open a contemplative space. [Click for more information](https://stoplisten.space)

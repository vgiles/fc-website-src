**Let Me Count The Ways (Portland, VIC)** was a project done in 2014, as part of a larger project of the same name in which people from  regional and rural Victoria document and share what they love about where they live and what they do. I contributed a [surface-exciting speaker installation (click for a shaky camera preview)](https://rogeralsop.wixsite.com/counting-the-ways/about1) at the [Julia St Creative Space, Portland](http://www.visitportland.com.au/listings/julia-street-creative-space-2/), and the display of photographs and other beloved objects and stories from people throughout the town and region.
